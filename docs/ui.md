# WM1303 Manager UI

> Web-based management interface for the WM1303 concentrator

## Overview

The WM1303 Manager is a single-page web application (`wm1303.html`) that provides complete management of the WM1303 concentrator system. It is accessible at:

```
http://<pi-ip>:8000/wm1303.html
```

The UI communicates with the backend via the [WM1303 REST API](./api.md) and receives real-time updates via WebSocket.

## Tabs

The UI has **5 tabs**: Status, Channels, Bridge, Spectrum, and Adv. Config.

> **v2.1.0 change:** The **Config** tab has been removed. TX Delay Factor has moved to Adv. Config → TX Queue Management.

### Status Tab

Real-time overview of system health and channel performance:

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| System Info | Hostname, CPU temp, memory, disk, uptime, kernel version |
| Active Channels | Count of active channels (up to 5 when Channel E is active) |
| Per-channel status | Frequency, BW, SF, RX/TX counts, RSSI, SNR, noise floor, duty cycle |
| Channel E status | Same metrics for the SX1261 channel |
| Signal Quality chart | Real-time per-channel RSSI and SNR |
| Packet Activity chart | Bar chart of per-channel RX/TX counts (Channel E in orange) |

### Channels Tab

Per-channel configuration interface:

#### IF Channels (A–D)
- Frequency (MHz)
- Bandwidth (kHz) — max 125 kHz
- Spreading Factor (SF7–SF12)
- Coding Rate (4/5–4/8)
- Preamble length
- TX Power (dBm)
- LBT enable + threshold (optional, per channel)
- Active toggle
- Channel name (display alias only)

> **v2.1.0 change:** The RF0/RF1 information block has been removed from the Channels tab. CAD is now mandatory and always active — there is no CAD toggle in the UI.

#### SX1261 Channel (E)
Same parameters as above, plus:
- RX Boost toggle
- Bandwidth limited to 62.5 kHz (since v2.0.5)
- Separate configuration section for clarity

All channels use a consistent grid layout (aligned since v2.0.0).

### Bridge Tab

Bridge rules management:

- List of all bridge rules
- Source → target channel mapping
- Packet type filter per rule (all, advert, text, position, path)
- Enable/disable toggle per rule
- Add / edit / delete rules
- Rules read from and written to `wm1303_ui.json` SSOT

### Spectrum Tab

Spectral analysis and channel monitoring charts:

| Chart | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **RSSI History** | Per-channel RSSI values over time |
| **SNR History** | Per-channel SNR values over time |
| **Noise Floor** | Per-channel noise floor from spectral scan |
| **CAD Activity** | Per-channel CAD results: **Clear** (green) and **Detected** (red) |
| **LBT History** | Per-channel LBT events with frequency and RSSI values |
| **TX Activity** | Per-channel TX counts and duty cycle |
| **Dedup Chart** | Deduplication event visualization |

Channel E is displayed in **orange** across all charts (since v2.0.1).

Extended color palette ensures all 5 channels are visually distinct.

#### v2.1.0 Spectrum Tab Changes

- **Removed 6 stat cards**: SPI Path, SX1261 Role, SX1261 Status, Active Channels, Spectral Scan Status, Noise Floor
- **Removed header/subtitle**: "📊 Channel E Spectrum & Signal Quality" header removed
- **CAD Activity chart simplified**: shows only Clear and Detected (removed SW/HW/Skipped distinction)
- **Info text added**: explanatory note below CAD chart explains that "Detected" means TX was force-sent after all CAD retries
- **LBT History chart fixed**: frequency and RSSI data now correctly captured (was previously stored as freq=0, rssi=None)

### Adv. Config Tab

Advanced system configuration:

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| GPIO Pins | Reset, power, SX1261 NSS, AD5338R reset pin assignments |
| RF Chains | RF0/RF1 center frequencies |
| IF Chains | Per-IF-chain enable, frequency offset, radio assignment |
| TX Queue Management | TX delay factor, direct TX delay factor (defaults: 0.0 since v2.1.0) |
| SPI Settings | Speed, burst size (informational) |
| System Actions | Restart service, restart pkt_fwd, hardware reset |

## UI Behavior Notes

### Channel Names Are Aliases
Channel names shown in the UI are **display aliases only**. Internal logic and API responses use stable channel identifiers (`channel_a` through `channel_e`). Users can rename channels freely without affecting system operation.

### CAD Is Mandatory (v2.1.0)
CAD is always active on every TX — there is no user toggle for CAD. The CAD Activity chart in the Spectrum tab shows the results of every mandatory CAD scan.

### LBT Controls
LBT can be independently enabled/disabled per channel in the Channels tab. When enabled, an RSSI threshold slider appears. LBT is optional and currently recommended to keep disabled (work-in-progress).

### Configuration Persistence
- UI changes are saved to `wm1303_ui.json` (SSOT) via the API
- Changes take effect within **5 seconds** (cache TTL auto-reload)
- No service restart required for most settings
- Bridge rule changes take effect immediately

### Frequency Display
All frequencies are displayed in **MHz** throughout the UI. Internal storage uses Hz.

### Bandwidth Display
All bandwidths are displayed in **kHz** throughout the UI. Internal storage uses Hz.

### Channel E Bandwidth
Since v2.0.5, the Channel E bandwidth dropdown is limited to **62.5 kHz** only. The 125/250/500 kHz options were removed because the SX1261 RX path through the concentrator HAL only supports sub-125 kHz bandwidths.

### RX Boost
The RX Boost toggle (Channel E) enables enhanced RX sensitivity on the SX1261. It is positioned before the Active toggle for better workflow (since v2.0.0).

### Hard Refresh After Upgrade
After every upgrade, perform a **hard browser refresh** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Ctrl+F5) to ensure the updated UI assets are loaded.
