## RF Chains

The SX1302/SX1303 baseband processor connects to two independent SX1250 radio transceivers, called RF chains. Each RF chain can be tuned to a different center frequency.

### RF Chain 0 (RF0)

- **Radio chip:** SX1250_0
- **Capabilities:** TX and RX
- **FEM connection:** Connected to SKY66420 (PA + LNA + RF switch)
- **TX enable:** Yes — all transmissions go through RF0
- **Typical center frequency:** 869.387 MHz (EU868 band)

### RF Chain 1 (RF1)

- **Radio chip:** SX1250_1
- **Capabilities:** RX only
- **FEM connection:** SAW filter path only (no PA)
- **TX enable:** No
- **Typical center frequency:** Same as RF0 (shared for narrow-band operation) or offset for wider coverage

### Important: TX Always Uses RF0

Regardless of which channel a packet needs to be transmitted on, **all TX goes through RF chain 0**. The HAL tunes the SX1250_0 radio to the target frequency for each transmission. RF chain 1 has no Power Amplifier connection and cannot transmit.

### RF Chain Configuration in global_conf.json

"radio_0": {
    "enable": true,

        "coeff_a": 0, "coeff_b": 0,
        "coeff_c": 20.41, "coeff_d": 2162.56, "coeff_e": 0
    },
    "tx_enable": true,

    "freq": 869387250,
    "rssi_offset": -215.4,
    "tx_enable": false
}
```

## IF Chains (Intermediate Frequency Demodulators)

The SX1302 has **10 IF (Intermediate Frequency) channels** that perform the actual LoRa and FSK demodulation:

| IF Chain | Type | Assignment | Description |
|----------|------|------------|-------------|
| IF0 | Multi-SF | RF0 | Channel 1 demodulator — can decode SF5-SF12 |
| IF1 | Multi-SF | RF0 | Channel 2 demodulator — can decode SF5-SF12 |
| IF2 | Multi-SF | RF0 | Channel 3 demodulator — can decode SF5-SF12 |
| IF3 | Multi-SF | RF0 | Channel 4 demodulator — can decode SF5-SF12 |
| IF4 | Multi-SF | RF0 | Reserved (disabled) |
| IF5 | Multi-SF | RF0 | Reserved (disabled) |
| IF6 | Multi-SF | RF0 | Reserved (disabled) |
| IF7 | Multi-SF | RF0 | Reserved (disabled) |
| IF8 | LoRa Service | RF0 | Single-SF demodulator (specific SF/BW) |
| IF9 | FSK | RF0 | FSK demodulator (disabled) |

### How IF Chains Work

Each IF chain is configured with a **frequency offset** relative to its parent RF chain's center frequency. The actual receive frequency is:

```
RX frequency = RF chain center freq + IF offset
```

For example, with RF0 center at 869,387,250 Hz:
- IF0 offset = +73,750 Hz → listens at 869,461,000 Hz (Channel A)
- IF1 offset = +200,750 Hz → listens at 869,588,000 Hz (Channel B)
- IF2 offset = -87,250 Hz → listens at 869,300,000 Hz (Channel D)

### Multi-SF Demodulators

The multi-SF demodulators can simultaneously detect and decode any spreading factor from SF5 to SF12 within their bandwidth. This means a single IF chain can receive packets from nodes using different spreading factors on the same frequency.

### IF Chain Configuration in global_conf.json

```json
"chan_multiSF_0": { "enable": true,  "radio": 0, "if": 73750 },
"chan_multiSF_1": { "enable": true,  "radio": 0, "if": 200750 },
"chan_multiSF_2": { "enable": true,  "radio": 0, "if": -87250 },
"chan_multiSF_3": { "enable": false, "radio": 0, "if": -187250 },
"chan_multiSF_4": { "enable": false, "radio": 0, "if": 0 },
"chan_multiSF_5": { "enable": false, "radio": 0, "if": 0 },
"chan_multiSF_6": { "enable": false, "radio": 0, "if": 0 },
"chan_multiSF_7": { "enable": false, "radio": 0, "if": 0 }
```

### Fixed Channel-to-IF Mapping

The mapping between channel names and IF chains is fixed in the backend code and never changes:

```python
CHANNEL_IF_MAP = {
    'ch-1':    0,   # Channel A → chan_multiSF_0
    'ch-2':    1,   # Channel B → chan_multiSF_1
    'ch-new':  2,   # Channel D → chan_multiSF_2
    'ch-notu': 3,   # Channel C → chan_multiSF_3
}
```

This fixed mapping prevents configuration drift and ensures consistent behavior regardless of channel ordering in the UI.

## Channel Configuration

Channels are configured in `wm1303_ui.json` (the SSOT). Each channel has the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Typical Values |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| `name` | Internal channel identifier | `ch-1`, `ch-2`, `ch-new` |
| `friendly_name` | Display name in UI | `Channel A`, `Channel B` |
| `frequency` | Center frequency in Hz | 869461000, 869588000 |
| `bandwidth` | Channel bandwidth in Hz | 125000, 250000, 500000 |
| `spreading_factor` | LoRa spreading factor | 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 |
| `coding_rate` | Forward Error Correction rate | "4/5", "4/6", "4/7", "4/8" |
| `tx_enabled` | Whether TX is allowed | true, false |
| `tx_power` | TX power in dBm | 2-27 |
| `active` | Whether channel is enabled | true, false |
| `preamble_length` | Number of preamble symbols | 8-65535 (typically 17) |
| `lbt_enabled` | Listen Before Talk per channel | true, false |
| `cad_enabled` | Channel Activity Detection | true, false |
| `lbt_rssi_target` | LBT RSSI threshold in dBm | -115, -110, etc. |

### Example Channel Configuration

```json
{
    "name": "ch-1",
    "frequency": 869525000,
    "bandwidth": 125000,
    "spreading_factor": 7,
    "coding_rate": "4/5",
    "tx_enabled": true,
    "tx_power": 14,
    "active": true,
    "preamble_length": 17,
    "friendly_name": "Channel A",
    "lbt_rssi_target": -115,
    "lbt_enabled": false,
    "cad_enabled": false
}
```

> **Note:** Channel friendly names are aliases for display purposes only. They should never be used as reference identifiers in code or configuration. Always use the internal `name` field (`ch-1`, `ch-2`, etc.) for programmatic references.

## Maximum 4 Channels

The system supports a maximum of **4 simultaneous channels**. While the SX1302 has 8 multi-SF demodulators, practical considerations limit the useful number of channels:

### Why Less Is Better / More Stable

1. **TX contention:** The SX1302 is half-duplex — during TX, all RX stops. More channels mean more bridge forwarding, more TX events, and longer RX blind windows.

2. **Frequency spread:** All IF chains share a single RF chain center frequency. The maximum IF offset is limited (~400 kHz), restricting the frequency range that can be covered.

3. **Bridge complexity:** With N channels and full bridge rules, the number of TX events per received packet grows as N-1. With 4 channels, a single RX can trigger 3 TX events.

4. **RX blind window calculation:**
   - 2 channels: ~200 ms per bridge event (~1.7% RX loss at 1 event/12s)
   - 3 channels: ~380 ms per bridge event (~3.2% RX loss)
   - 4 channels: ~490 ms per bridge event (~4.1% RX loss)

5. **Noise floor monitoring:** More channels with LBT/CAD means more spectral scan overhead.

**Recommendation:** Use 2-3 channels for optimal stability. 4 channels is the practical maximum for acceptable performance.

## MeshCore Sync Word

MeshCore uses a custom sync word to distinguish its packets from LoRaWAN and other LoRa traffic:

| Parameter | Value | Hex |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Sync Word | 5156 | 0x1424 |

The sync word is configured in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
radio:
  sync_word: 5156
```

And in `global_conf.json`:

```json
"lorawan_public": false
```

Setting `lorawan_public: false` tells the HAL to use a private sync word rather than the standard LoRaWAN sync word (0x3444). The actual MeshCore sync word (0x1424) is configured at the application level.

## LoRaWAN Compatibility

This system is **not LoRaWAN compatible** by design:

- **Different sync word:** MeshCore uses 0x1424, LoRaWAN uses 0x3444 (public) or 0x1424 with different network identification
- **Different protocol:** MeshCore uses its own packet format with route types, payload types, hop counts, and path tracking
- **No LoRaWAN Network Server:** The packet forwarder runs locally without cloud connectivity
- **`lorawan_public: false`:** The HAL is configured for private network mode

MeshCore packets and LoRaWAN packets can coexist on the same frequencies because the different sync words prevent cross-reception. The SX1302 will only demodulate packets matching its configured sync word.

## Frequency Planning (EU868)

The system operates in the European 868 MHz ISM band. Key frequency regulations:

| Sub-band | Frequency Range | Duty Cycle | Max Power | Notes |
|----------|----------------|------------|-----------|-------|
| g1 | 868.0 - 868.6 MHz | 1% | 25 mW ERP | Limited airtime |
| g2 | 868.7 - 869.2 MHz | 0.1% | 25 mW ERP | Very limited |
| g3 | 869.4 - 869.65 MHz | 10% | 500 mW ERP | **Primary band** |
| g4 | 869.7 - 870.0 MHz | No limit | 5 mW ERP | Low power |

**Typical channel placement (EU868):**

```
868.0    868.5    869.0    869.4  869.65   870.0
  │        │        │   g3:  │ ████ │        │
  │        │        │  10%   │ch-a  │        │
  │        │        │ 500mW  │ch-b  │        │
  │        │        │        │ch-d  │        │
  ▼        ▼        ▼        ▼      ▼        ▼
```

The g3 sub-band (869.4-869.65 MHz) is preferred because it offers the highest allowed power (500 mW / 27 dBm) and most generous duty cycle (10%).

## TX/RX Architecture

The SX1302 is fundamentally a **half-duplex** system on each RF chain:

### During Normal RX Operation

```
SX1250_0 (RF0): RX active — antenna → FEM LNA → SX1250 → SX1302 baseband → IF demodulators
SX1250_1 (RF1): RX active — (via SAW filter path)
SX1261: Available for spectral scan (separate SPI bus)
```

### During TX

```
RX ──stops──┐
            ├── RF switch → TX mode          (~0.1 ms)
            ├── TX airtime                   (65-230 ms depending on SF/payload)
            ├── RF switch → RX mode          (~0.1 ms)
            ├── AGC recalibration             (30-50 ms)
RX ──resumes┘
```

### RX Blind Window per TX Event

| Channel Config | SF | Airtime (60B payload) | AGC Recovery | Total Blind Window |
|---------------|----|-----------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| SF7 / BW125k | 7 | ~65 ms | ~40 ms | ~105 ms |
| SF8 / BW125k | 8 | ~120 ms | ~40 ms | ~160 ms |
| SF11 / BW250k | 11 | ~200 ms | ~40 ms | ~240 ms |
| SF12 / BW125k | 12 | ~400 ms | ~40 ms | ~440 ms |

## Noise Floor / RSSI / SNR Per Channel

The system maintains per-channel signal quality metrics:

### Noise Floor

Determined by the NoiseFloorMonitor using SX1261 spectral scan data:
- Updated every 30 seconds
- Rolling buffer of 20 samples per channel
- Frequency matching: channel frequency ± BW/2
- Typical values: -90 to -120 dBm depending on environment

### RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)

- Measured per received packet by the SX1302
- Includes RSSI temperature compensation (rssi_tcomp coefficients)
- RSSI offset configured per RF chain (-215.4 dB default)
- Available per-channel: last RSSI, average RSSI, min/max

### SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)

- Computed by the SX1302 baseband processor per packet
- Typical good values: > 5 dB
- Minimum decodable: approximately -20 dB (depending on SF)
- Higher SF can decode at lower SNR

## RX CRC Errors

The SX1302 performs CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) validation on received packets:

- **CRC OK:** Packet payload is intact — forwarded to the backend
- **CRC BAD:** Packet payload is corrupted — **discarded** by the packet forwarder
- **CRC NONE:** No CRC in packet — depends on configuration (typically rejected)

### What CRC Errors Mean

1. **Occasional CRC errors are normal** — RF interference, weak signals at the edge of reception range, or collision with other transmitters can corrupt packets
2. **High CRC error rate** indicates problems:
   - Antenna issues (disconnected, damaged, wrong frequency band)
   - Excessive interference at the operating frequency
   - SX1302 receiving signals from a different LoRa network with different parameters
   - Hardware issue with the SX1250 radio or FEM
3. **CRC validation was initially disabled** in early development, causing corrupt packets to be processed. This was fixed as the `crc_fix` deployment.

CRC errors are counted in the packet forwarder statistics and visible in the RX Watchdog metrics.
