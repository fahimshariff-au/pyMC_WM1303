# TX Queue & Scheduling

> Complete TX processing pipeline from RX reception to radio transmission

## Overview

Every packet transmitted by the WM1303 system passes through a multi-stage pipeline: reception, bridge evaluation, queue management, spectrum checks, and finally radio transmission. Each channel maintains its own independent `ChannelTXQueue` instance with configurable parameters for queue size, TTL, and overflow behavior.

```

See [System Architecture](architecture.md) for the full system diagram and [Software Components](software.md) for details on each module.

## Phase 1 — RX Reception

| Step | Component | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1.1 | SX1302 Radio | Receives LoRa packet on one of the IF chains |
| 1.2 | Packet Forwarder | Sends PUSH_DATA (UDP) to Backend |
| 1.3 | WM1303 Backend `_handle_udp()` | Parses rxpk JSON: frequency, SF, RSSI, SNR, payload |
| 1.4 | Backend dispatch | Routes to correct VirtualLoRaRadio (channel_a/b/d) |
| 1.5 | Bridge Engine | Receives RX event on the corresponding channel |

### UDP PUSH_DATA Format (rxpk)

```json
{
  "rxpk": [{
    "freq": 869.461,
    "datr": "SF8BW125",
    "rssi": -81,
    "lsnr": 13.5,
    "size": 56,
    "data": "<base64 payload>"
  }]
}
```

See [Radio Configuration](radio.md) for details on how IF chains map to channels.

## Phase 2 — Bridge Engine Processing

| Step | Action | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| 2.1 | Dedup check | Hash packet and compare against recently seen packets. Prevents echo loops: if the same packet was already received (within the dedup window), it is not forwarded again. |
| 2.2 | Bridge rules evaluation | Which rules match? Each rule defines a source-channel to target-channel mapping (e.g. `channel_a → channel_b`, `channel_a → channel_d`). |
| 2.3 | Repeater handler | MeshCore-specific processing: increment hop count, update path bytes, adjust packet size. |
| 2.4 | TX batch window | Set TX hold (2s batch window). All target channels are queued simultaneously to prevent fragmentation. |
| 2.5 | Fire sends | `firing N radio sends concurrently` — parallel TX to all target channels via their individual TX queues. |

### Bridge Rules Example

Bridge rules are configured in the [WM1303 Manager UI](ui.md) and define how packets are forwarded between channels. Each rule specifies:

- Source channel (where the packet was received)
- Target channel (where it should be forwarded)
- Whether the repeater handler should process the packet

```
rule r1774374816452:  channel_a → repeater → channel_a (echo back)
rule r1774374817571:  channel_a → repeater → channel_d
rule r_rpt_to_b:      channel_a → repeater → channel_b
```

See [Configuration Reference](configuration.md) for bridge rule configuration details.

## Phase 3 — TX Queue Processing

Each channel has its own `ChannelTXQueue` instance. This is where most of the processing work happens.

### Queue Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Source | Description |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Max queue size | 15 | `wm1303_ui.json` → `adv_config.max_cache_size` | Per channel. Prevents memory exhaustion under heavy load |
| TTL (time-to-live) | 5 sec | `wm1303_ui.json` → `adv_config.tx_packet_ttl_seconds` | Packets older than TTL are automatically dropped |
| Overflow policy | drop oldest | `wm1303_ui.json` → `adv_config.tx_overflow_policy` | When queue is full, the oldest packet is removed |
| Processing order | FIFO | hardcoded | First In, First Out — oldest packets are processed first |

### Batch Window

When the Bridge Engine forwards a packet to multiple channels simultaneously, a **2-second batch window** is used:

1. Bridge Engine evaluates all matching rules for an incoming packet
2. A 2-second TX hold is set to collect all target channels
3. After the batch window, all queued packets are sent concurrently
4. This prevents fragmentation — all channels get the forwarded packet within the same time window

### Inter-Packet Gap

When multiple packets are queued for sequential transmission, a **50 ms inter-packet gap** is maintained between TX operations. This allows:

- The SX1302 to complete RF switch transitions
- AGC recalibration between transmissions
- SPI bus settling time

## Phase 4 — Radio TX

The SX1302 is **half-duplex** — RX is interrupted during the entire TX cycle.

| Step | Duration | What Happens |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 4.1 | ~0.1 ms | RF switch → TX mode (RX stops) |
| 4.2 | 65-230 ms | Packet transmission (depends on SF + payload size) |
| 4.3 | ~0.1 ms | RF switch → RX mode |
| 4.4 | 30-50 ms | AGC recalibration (automatic) |
| 4.5 | — | RX resumes |

### TX Airtime per Channel

Typical MeshCore packet ~56-80 bytes:

| Channel | SF | BW | 60 bytes | 80 bytes |
|---------|----|----|----------|----------|
| ch-a | SF8 | 125 kHz | ~120 ms | ~150 ms |
| ch-b | SF7 | 125 kHz | ~65 ms | ~80 ms |
| ch-d | SF7 | 125 kHz | ~65 ms | ~80 ms |

### TX Throughput per Channel (including overhead)

| Channel | LBT | Airtime | AGC Reload | Total |
|---------|-----|---------|------------|-------|
| ch-a (SF8, no LBT) | 0 ms | ~120 ms | ~40 ms | ~160 ms |
| ch-b (SF7, with LBT+CAD) | ~5 ms | ~65 ms | ~40 ms | ~110 ms |
| ch-d (SF7, with LBT+CAD) | ~5 ms | ~65 ms | ~40 ms | ~110 ms |

### RX Interruption

The SX1302 is half-duplex on the same RF chain. RX is interrupted during the full TX cycle:

```
RX active ────┐
              ├── RF switch to TX       (~0.1 ms)
              ├── TX airtime            (65-150 ms)
              ├── RF switch to RX       (~0.1 ms)
              ├── AGC reload/recal      (30-50 ms)
RX resumes ───┘
```

| Channel | RX Blind Window per TX |
|---------|-----------------------|
| ch-a (SF8) | ~160-200 ms |
| ch-b (SF7) | ~100-120 ms |
| ch-d (SF7) | ~100-120 ms |

### Sequential Bridge Forwarding (3 channels)

Packets are sent **sequentially** — the SX1302 can only transmit one packet at a time:

```
├─ TX ch-A (SF8): ~160 ms  ──► RX blind
├─ TX ch-B (SF7): ~110 ms  ──► RX blind
├─ TX ch-D (SF7): ~110 ms  ──► RX blind
└─ Total RX interruption: ~380 ms
```

With a typical message every ~12 seconds:
- 380 ms / 12,000 ms = ~3.2% RX loss

See [Radio Configuration](radio.md) for RF chain details and [Hardware Overview](hardware.md) for the SX1302 half-duplex architecture.

## Echo Prevention

The system implements self-echo prevention using packet hashing:

1. When a packet is received (RX), a hash is computed from the payload
2. Before forwarding via bridge rules, the hash is checked against recently transmitted packets
3. If the hash matches a recently sent packet, it is recognized as an echo and dropped
4. The dedup TTL (default: 300 seconds) controls how long hashes are retained

This prevents infinite forwarding loops where a bridged packet is received back on the original channel and forwarded again.

## TX Hold During Noise Floor Measurements

Every 30 seconds, the `NoiseFloorMonitor` triggers a 4-second TX hold:

1. All TX queues pause (packets accumulate but are not transmitted)
2. The SX1261 spectral scan gets a clean measurement window
3. Noise floor RSSI values are harvested and fed into per-channel rolling buffers
4. After 4 seconds, queues resume and process any accumulated packets

This creates a brief transmission gap but ensures accurate noise floor data for LBT decisions. See [LBT & CAD](lbt_cad.md) for full details.

## SPI Bus Timing

The system uses two SPI buses operating at 2 MHz:

| Device | SPI Path | Clock | Function |
|--------|----------|-------|----------|
| SX1302 | `/dev/spidev0.0` | 2 MHz | Main concentrator (RX + TX) |
| SX1261 | `/dev/spidev0.1` | 2 MHz | Spectral scan, LBT, CAD |

### SPI Bus Load Analysis

| Activity | SPI Time per Cycle | Frequency | Bus Load |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|----------|
| RX polling | ~1 ms | 10x/sec | ~1% |
| TX transmit | ~2 ms | incidental | <0.5% |
| Spectral scan | ~5 ms per freq step | 1x per 30s sweep | ~5-10% |
| **Total** | | | **< 15%** |

At 2 MHz, the SPI bus has a theoretical throughput of 250 KB/s. There is ample bandwidth for all operations. The two SPI buses operate independently, so SX1261 spectral scanning does not compete with SX1302 RX/TX operations.

See [Hardware Overview](hardware.md) for the physical SPI bus architecture.

## Background Processes

### RX Watchdog

The RX Watchdog continuously monitors radio health using three detection methods:

| Detection Method | Trigger | Action |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| PUSH_DATA statistics | 2x `rxnb=0` while TX active (~60s) | Restart packet forwarder |
| RSSI spike detection | 5+ strong signals but no successful RX (~60s) | Restart packet forwarder |
| RX timeout | No RX packet for 180 seconds | Restart packet forwarder |

The watchdog ensures the system self-recovers from radio lockups, which can occur after TX-induced SX1250 desensitization. See [Hardware Overview](hardware.md) for details on the FEM/PA issue.

## Troubleshooting

### TX Queue Full (queue_full errors)

**Symptoms:** Nodes do not receive ACK, journal shows `queue full, dropping packet`.

**Solutions:**
1. Check `pending` value via `/api/wm1303/tx_queues`
2. If pending > 10: restart service (`sudo systemctl restart pymc-repeater`)
3. Verify TTL and max queue size are correctly configured
4. Check if TX hold is stuck (noise floor monitor issue)

### Packets Never Transmitted

**Symptoms:** `total_sent` stays at 0, queue fills up.

**Possible causes:**
- LBT blocking all transmissions (check `lbt_blocked` counter)
- TX hold stuck (check journal for noise floor monitor errors)
- Packet forwarder not running (check `systemctl status pymc-repeater`)
- SPI bus error (check `dmesg | grep spi`)

### High `dropped_ttl` Count

**Symptoms:** Many packets are dropped due to TTL expiration.

**Cause:** Packets are waiting too long in the queue before being processed. This can happen during extended TX holds or when LBT/CAD blocks are frequent.

**Solutions:**
1. Increase TTL if appropriate (in `wm1303_ui.json` → `adv_config.tx_packet_ttl_seconds`)
2. Check noise floor scan interval — 30s may be too frequent for heavy traffic
3. Reduce the number of active channels to decrease TX contention

### High `dropped_overflow` Count

**Symptoms:** Queue is frequently full, packets are dropped.

**Cause:** More packets arriving than can be transmitted. Common when many bridge rules forward to the same channel.

**Solutions:**
1. Review bridge rules — reduce unnecessary forwarding
2. Check if TX is actually working (not stuck)
3. Consider reducing the number of channels or bridge rules
